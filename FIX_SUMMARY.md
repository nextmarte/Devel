# Fix Summary: DeepSeek AI Schema Validation Error

## Problem Statement
The transcription service was encountering a critical error when processing audio/media files through the AI pipeline:

```
INVALID_ARGUMENT: Schema validation failed. Parse Errors: - candidates.0.message: must have required property 'content'
```

This error prevented the following features from working:
- Audio transcription with AI correction
- Speaker identification in transcriptions
- Meeting summary/ata generation

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the error, the root cause was identified as a schema mismatch between:
- **genkitx-deepseek v1.0.1**: Returns `message.text` (string) with role `'assistant'`
- **Genkit v1.20.0**: Expects `message.content` (array of parts) with role `'model'`

This incompatibility caused the schema validation to fail when the DeepSeek API responses were processed by Genkit.

## Solution Implemented
A surgical patch was created for the `genkitx-deepseek` npm package using `patch-package`. The patch makes minimal changes to fix the schema mismatch:

### Changes in the Patch
1. **Schema Definition** (runner.js & runner.d.ts)
   - Changed `message.text: z.string()` to `message.content: z.array(z.object({ text: z.string() }))`
   - Changed `role: z.literal('assistant')` to `role: z.literal('model')`

2. **Response Conversion Functions**
   - `fromDeepSeekChoice`: Converts API response to `{ role: 'model', content: [{ text: '...' }] }`
   - `fromDeepSeekChunkChoice`: Converts streaming chunks to the same format

3. **Streaming Callback**
   - Fixed to pass `candidate.message.content` directly instead of reconstructing it

### Files Modified
- `package.json`: Added `postinstall` script to auto-apply patches
- `patches/genkitx-deepseek+1.0.1.patch`: Patch file (104 lines)
- `DEEPSEEK_SCHEMA_FIX.md`: Comprehensive documentation

## Testing & Validation
✅ Schema validation test created and passed
✅ TypeScript type checking passes
✅ Production build succeeds
✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
✅ No breaking changes to existing code

## Impact
This fix enables the following flows to work correctly:
1. **correctTranscriptionErrors** - Corrects grammatical errors in transcriptions
2. **identifySpeakers** - Identifies and labels speakers in the text
3. **summarizeText** - Generates meeting summaries/atas

## Deployment Notes
- The patch is automatically applied after `npm install` via the postinstall script
- No environment variable changes required
- No configuration changes required
- Compatible with existing codebase

## Future Considerations
If `genkitx-deepseek` is updated to v1.0.2+, check the changelog to see if the schema issue has been fixed upstream. If so, the patch can be safely removed.

## Commits
1. `3a978af` - Fix DeepSeek schema validation error by patching genkitx-deepseek
2. `8afbab9` - Add documentation for DeepSeek schema fix

## Security Summary
No security vulnerabilities were introduced by this change. The patch only modifies the data structure transformation to match Genkit's expected schema format.
